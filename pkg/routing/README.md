# Routing ðŸšš

## ðŸ“Œ Description

The `routing` package provides a set of algorithms tailored to solve the vehicle routing problem, specifically focusing on the allocation of loads to drivers to minimize delivery costs.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Dynamic Routing Algorithms**: Choose between multiple greedy algorithms to determine the most cost-effective delivery routes.

- **Optimized Scheduling**: Minimize total costs, considering both the number of drivers and the total delivery time.

- **Extendable Design**: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extensions with new algorithms and strategies in the future.
